# Fuckers-floatbeats.

Basically every floatbeat i have made, all using extremely long and complex methods using sampledata=

Pretty much all of them should be played at 48kz for proper audio 

I recommend greggman as an online player, but as long as it supports floatbeat and 48kz audio, anything can work.
